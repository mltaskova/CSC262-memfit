The C implementation for this assignment is pretty poorly constructed - I wish I could write code more smoothely in C
However, I redid the whole assignment following the same bullet points - support first, best, worst, random fit, compact the free list, and calculate the statistics
I could not implement next fit and part of the reason why is because I started getting very lost in my code
I would love to discuss the next fit C implementation!

I used the same input.txt file and I compared the outcomes from both implementations to check accuracy
